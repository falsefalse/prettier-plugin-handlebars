# Editor Setup

The plugin works through Prettier. Editors must be configured so Prettier is selected as the formatter for `.hbs` / `.handlebars` files and can resolve the plugin from the project.

## VS Code

Install:

- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- Optional companion extension: [HBS Master](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poliklot.hbs-master)

Recommended workspace settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.documentSelectors": ["**/*.hbs", "**/*.handlebars"],
  "[handlebars]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
}
```

Recommended Prettier config:

```js
/** @type {import("prettier").Config} */
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@poliklot/prettier-plugin-handlebars'],
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ["*.hbs", "*.handlebars"],
      options: {
        parser: "handlebars",
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

If VS Code still does not format files, open the Prettier output panel and check whether it is using the workspace Prettier package.

## WebStorm / PhpStorm / other JetBrains IDEs

1. Install `prettier` and `@poliklot/prettier-plugin-handlebars` in the project.
2. Open **Settings → Languages & Frameworks → JavaScript → Prettier**.
3. Point **Prettier package** to the local `node_modules/prettier` package.
4. Enable **Run on save** for `.hbs` / `.handlebars` if desired.
5. Keep the explicit `overrides` rule in your Prettier config.

If the IDE formats the file as plain HTML, run the CLI command below to verify that project config is correct:

```bash
npx prettier --check "**/*.{hbs,handlebars}"
```

## Neovim / Vim

Use the local project Prettier binary and pass the file path so Prettier can resolve config and parser overrides.

Example command for formatter plugins:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/prettier --stdin-filepath template.hbs
```

If your formatter does not pass `--stdin-filepath`, use explicit plugin and parser args:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/prettier \
  --plugin @poliklot/prettier-plugin-handlebars \
  --parser handlebars
```

## Sublime Text

[JsPrettier](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JsPrettier) reads the position back out of
Prettier's stderr rather than out of the error object, and it matches on the plain name. That is
why syntax errors from this plugin call themselves `SyntaxError` rather than something more
specific:

```
[error] page.hbs: SyntaxError: unclosed tag: expected </span> (3:3)
```

Rename that and the cursor goes nowhere. `src/errors.ts` says so next to the assignment, and
`test/syntax-errors.test.ts` has a test that fails if it drifts.

## Syntax errors in the editor

Malformed templates are rejected rather than reformatted, so an editor that formats on save will
report a failure instead of silently writing a degraded file. The error carries a source range
(`loc.start` and `loc.end`), which is enough for an editor to select the offending construct, not
just jump to the line.

If the editor reports the error but does not move the cursor, it is reading stderr rather than the
error object — see the Sublime Text note above.

## CLI sanity check

When an editor behaves differently from the terminal, use this as the source of truth:

```bash
npx prettier --write "**/*.{hbs,handlebars}"
```

If that command works, the plugin is configured correctly and the remaining problem is editor resolution.
